# Changelog

## 2.0.0

- Ships as a Claude Code plugin in its own repo (`korn9537/ai-kit`), which is also the `korn9537` marketplace.
  Projects enable `ai-kit@korn9537` in `.claude/settings.json` instead of copying `ai-kit/` (README §Migrating).
- Hooks are wired in `hooks/hooks.json` with `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`; `settings.hooks.json` is gone. Every hook
  exits silently in a project without `ai/kit/`.
- New `session-start.sh` injects `CLAUDE.core.md` (replaces the `@ai-kit/CLAUDE.core.md` import; plain text without
  `jq`) and records the plugin path in `<git-common-dir>/ai-kit-root` for the pre-commit shim, as `init` does. Hooks
  use the git toplevel of the project dir, so a session started in a subdirectory still finds `ai/kit/`.
- Agents are `ai-kit:change-reviewer` and `ai-kit:business-analyst`, read from the plugin; `.claude/agents/` copies
  must go.
- `sync.mjs` is replaced by `scripts/kit.mjs init|check` and the `/ai-kit:init`, `/ai-kit:check` commands; no
  `install` or `collect`. `check` also fails when the plugin is enabled in no settings scope or 1.x leftovers remain
  (including `code_dirs` `ai-kit` and a missing `shared_checkout_doc`).
- The `.githooks/pre-commit` shim finds the kit through `ai-kit-root`; without it, it warns and runs only
  `ai/kit/pre-commit.sh`.
- `shared_checkout_doc` defaults to the plugin's `docs/shared-checkout.md`; templates drop `ai-kit` from
  `code_dirs`. `VERSION` is gone: `version` in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` is the only source.

## 1.4.1

- `post-edit-check.sh` runs in a repo with no `package.json`; `node_modules` is required only when one exists.

## 1.4.0

- Conventions for `csharp` and `typescript`. `general.md` gains one save = one write (upload first, bulk), paged
  lists, no read in a loop, server-side authorization, no committed secrets, 24px targets (44pt in `dart.md`);
  `sql.md` gains names, enum strings, FKs, unique names, concurrent indexes, three-step NOT NULL, idempotent imports,
  DDL via migrations. Moved out: `/v1`, the UUID v7 column default, problem+json `code`, the append-only trigger.
- `sync.mjs check` reports an `ai/kit/config.json` that is malformed or not a JSON object instead of throwing.

## 1.3.0

- Cross-repo coding rules in `conventions/` (`general.md` plus one file per language), chosen by config
  `conventions` (default `[]`); read by both agents and `CLAUDE.core.md`, checked by `sync.mjs check`.

## 1.2.2

- The closing phrase is shown without backticks where the model is told to write it (`CLAUDE.core.md`, the
  `review-before-stop.sh` block message), since the hook does not count a backticked phrase. Code spans in kit
  Markdown stay on one line, so prettier in a project's pre-commit does not reflow them.

## 1.2.1

- A commit subagent never launches its own reviewer (it doubled every review). `review-before-stop.sh` counts
  `Review closed: re-checked once` (not quoted) in a main-session reply right after a re-check as a review. It also
  reads the reply being stopped from the hook input (`last_assistant_message`), which may not be in the transcript yet.

## 1.2.0

- Multi-commit plans run with the main session as coordinator and one fresh background subagent per commit
  (`CLAUDE.core.md`); `review-before-stop.sh` counts a finished subagent's edits and asks for a fresh background
  reviewer per commit with one re-check.
- `handoff-nudge.sh` (UserPromptSubmit) and report item 7 "Next session"; config `handoff.max_context`.

## 1.1.0

- `check-comments.mjs`: Go and Dart support. Go directives and Dart `// ignore:` lines do not count as comments,
  `_test.go`/`_test.dart` files are exempt from the dated check, and Go files marked
  `// Code generated ... DO NOT EDIT.` are skipped.

## 1.0.0

- First portable release: `CLAUDE.core.md`, agents `business-analyst` and
  `change-reviewer`, hooks (review-before-stop, review-snapshot, post-edit-check, git-add-all-guard,
  build-while-dev-guard), pre-commit runner, `check-comments.mjs`, `sync.mjs` install/check/collect, `ai/kit/`
  templates.
